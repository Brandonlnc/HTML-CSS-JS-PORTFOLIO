        <p>During my first year as a general member at UBC Supermileage, I designed a new steering block for the Gasoline Prototype Vehicle. Aside from housing the wheel mount and hub, the steering block also includes housing connections for the brakes, handlebars and the kingpin connection to the chassis plates. <br>
          <br> The then steering mechanism worked through a simple direct steering system, with an adjustable threaded rod connecting the steering blocks attached to either front wheel. The vehicle is steered with ergonomic handlebars containing the throttle, brake lever, and fuel usage display.

        <p> Observations from the previous year's part failure meant that the part needed to be redesigned and replaced. By analysis, I concluded that the part failed in shear loading due to an unitentional crash and rollout. The new part was therefore redesigned to be sturdier and capable of withstanding larger shearing stress loads without deformation, especially for tight corners at high speeds. 
        <br>
          <br> Using SolidWorks and ANSYS Benchwork, an optimal design was manufactured, while limiting areas of stress concentrations. Geometry, material constraints, space considerations, manufacturability, wear and ease of adjustment were highly considered. This was to ensure that the vehicle can achieve the best fuel efficiency. Adjusting mechanisms regarding the toe, camber, scrub radius, kingpin inclination, and more were considered for an optimal steering experience.

        <p> The parts were waterjet cut from aluminum, and machined to 0.5-0.03mm tolerances using CNC tooling, milling machine, lathe, and other. The difference parts were then fastened together with screws and locktite to ensure they would not come undone under stress.
         <br>
          <br> Competing that same year in the Shell Eco Marathon Americas 2024, our Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) prototype earned the 5th spot that year in terms of fuel efficiency. The steering block and neighbouring structures reported no signs of damage despite multiple tight and high speed cornering.</p>
